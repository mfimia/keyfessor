# Keyfessor

Keyfessor is a great app to enhance your typing skills. It is made of 10 texts chosen randomly (a few of them coming from React Docs (turns out they are very typeable :D) in English language.)

You will have the opportunity to test yourself and find out how fast and how accurate you can type. The app includes inmediate feedback with a digital keyboard and sound cues that will let you know if you pressed the right key.

Once you have completed all 10 texts (it should take you around 10 mins) Keyfessor will let you know what's your title. "Keyboard God", "Drunk and Reckless", "Johnny Two Fingers" or "Journalist" are just a few of the possible titles that you could get. There are many more :D.

Last but not least, you will be able to see leaderboard with scores submitted by other typers and of course to submit your score and show off your typing skills.
