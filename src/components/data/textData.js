  "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from fortyfive BC, making it over two thousand years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at HampdenSydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage.",
  "There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which do not look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there is not anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.",
  "props and state are both plain JavaScript objects. While both hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in one important way. props get passed to the component, like function parameters, whereas state is managed within the component, like variables declared within a function.",
  "React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.",
  "This ensures, for example, that if both Parent and Child call setState during a click event, Child is not re rendered twice. Instead, React flushes the state updates at the end of the browser event. This results in significant performance improvements in larger apps.",
  "We will assume that you have some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript, but you should be able to follow along even if you are coming from a different programming language. We will also assume that you are familiar with programming concepts like functions, objects, arrays, and to a lesser extent, classes.",
  "As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem.",
  "First, open this Starter Code in a new tab. The new tab should display an empty tictactoe game board and React code. We will be editing the React code in this tutorial.",
  "React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called components.",
